# FGPlayer
A few batch scripts that show the ingame activity in Fall Guys. (You can add it as an overlay in OBS for example)

**Note:** I am making those scripts just for fun, so please keep that in mind if there isnÂ´t a lot of activity in this project.
This project is still in partial delevopement, meaning that there is unfinished code in some of the files, which might be used later.

You can run the Start.bat script, which will automatically download FGPlayer.
FGPlayer is using external dependencies.
