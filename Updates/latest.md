Update 1.16 - Released 29.10.2025 (R.I.P Nala)

+ If matchmaking is cancelled, you should now be returned to the main menu state.
+ Disconnections are now being checked if they have been server initiated or client initiated (Some client side disconnection requests might still show up as server disconnections)
+ Made a change to the checkpoint system, which should prevent issues like being stuck in the 3... 2... 1... phase, which could happen if the game has started before the script reached that position.
