Beta improvements:
	- When launching FGPlayer, if you have the 'usenewingamesystem' variable defined (to 1) you can test out the new improved ingame system, to see if it helps with performance
	- When defining the 'dontperformlvllookup' variable, you can skip online database requests.The Share Code will be used as the level name instead.
