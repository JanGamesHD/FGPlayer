Updates and bug fixes:
- Leaving the game in progress will now be logged as an elimination
- Victory screen has been improved. Losses should no longer be detected as wins in certain situations.
- Cancelling matchmkaing no longer results in a main menu soft lock
- Loading creative level names should now work better (Creative level loading can be disabled)
- The script should now no longer be stuck at the starting 3... 2... 1... scene after the round has already started.

Issues:
- Matchmaking might not always return you to the main menu. Since this issue does not result in a softlock, this will be checked again later.
